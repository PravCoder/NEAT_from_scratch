# NEAT Algorithm from Scratch

This is a implementation of the NEAT paper: https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

NEAT stands for Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies, it is a method for evolving the archtiecture/toplogy of neural network through a evolutionary algorithm to solve some problem.



02/06/2025: This implementation does not work, this is a failed attempt.
